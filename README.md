System Analysis and Design

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

DrivePass was a company looking to help people pass their driving tests. They offered online classes, on the road testing, practice tests, and generally just wanted to improve the success rate of people looking to obtain the driver's licenses. 

**What did you do particularly well?**

I included some basic research in my designs, such as the most commonly used web browsers are Chrome and Safari. The thought process was to show the client in the presentation that their system is being taken seriously by a well informed team of professionals. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

My diagrams are very simple as they are only attempting to show understanding on the concepts. If I could improve one thing, it would be more detailed diagrams in my design document. For example, my use case diagram has IT department functionally assumed within management and administration. I would like to extend this diagram to include an IT admin which had access to account and website maintenance which other employees and customers would not.  

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I interpreted the interview with the client, provided to us, to imply the company was a start up company which was tight on funds and staffing. I thought to include an AI based ticketing system for issues which arise with the website, which would include a chatbot to answer questions 24/7. I would not expect the company to have 24/7 staffing, but their customers would not always be making purchases during business hours. Customers would be able to help themselves, and this would have the added effect of alleviating the calls being fielded by the administration in the office. Overall, this would lower frustrations of all users while having the potential to increase profits.  

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

I try to keep the user in mind when I am designing software. How might the user use the software? How might they misinterpret the software? Are the users young and tech savvy? Are the users older and going to require a more simple design? For me, the experience of the user while using my software is the most important aspect. From how well the software executes its primary function for the user to the security of private information, everything ultimately comes down to the experience of the users you are designing the system for. When making decisions about the design of a system in the future, I would always ask how this decision would affect the user.
